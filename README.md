This room was a whirlwind introduction to Rust, hitting the high notes before unceremoniously dropping us into the challenge, which has us manipulating a challenge string. Initially, to just complete the room, I cheated a bit, and used cyberchef to get the flag.  This, of course, is highly unsatisfactory, and I want to right that wrong by completing this challenge the right way, with Rust. To do so, we need to dig into how to work with strings, and how to use Rust's conventions to not only solve the challenge, but do it the way things should be done in the language.
